\subsection{Theory of Mind}
While Theory of Mind and the research related to it in a purely psychological understanding is more of a foundation for the paper in question it is still important to know what the term means and the research it is related to, to grasp the context of the paper at hand.\\
Theory of Mind encompasses all abilities that infer various mental states based on contextual information. The term Theory of Mind (ToM) gained traction in the late 1970s and has since found firm footing in developmental psychology where the term is used to determine the existence and emergence of ToM in children. ToM is also a key part to enable predictions of behaviour based on an agent's mental state.\cite{theory_of_mind}\\
The research around ToM in child development plays an important role in Kosinski's work since he uses both well-cited methods and results from this field to first construct ToM tests for LLMs and consecutively compare the LLMs' performances to that of children in different age groups. Therefore, the relevant methods and research results will be shortly summised in the following. In order to assess a child's ability to differentiate reality from beliefs, false-belief tests were introduced by several researchers \cite{fb_test_places_1,fb_test_places_2,fb_test_contents}. In theses tests children were exposed to situations in which they have to make distinctions between reality and the knowledge or belief of another person about reality and predict someone's behavior according to it. Kosinskis work is based on two kinds of these tests.\\
First, the Smarties Task developed by Perner et al. in 1987. In this experiment children around age 4 are shown a tube of "Smarties" (chocolate candy), asked its contents and then shown the real contents which were actually random objects and not candy. They would then be asked the questions what another child who did not see the real contents of the tube would expect to be inside, thus testing the reasoning skills about false beliefs of others. \cite{fb_test_contents}
Second, the Sally-Anne Task first used in a study from 1983 \cite{fb_test_places_1} and then again in 1985 \cite{fb_test_places_2} (this time coining the name Sally-Anne Task) tests the same reasoning ability of attributing false beliefs to others. In this task two agents are introduced (typically using puppets). One agent places an item and leaves the scene while the other agent moves the item before the first agent comes back to look for the item. The children are then asked about the expected behaviour of the first agent who did not witness the displacement of the item. The task is solved correctly when the child predicts that the first agent will search the item in the place where they left it before the second agent moved it, thus proving the child's ability to infer false beliefs of other people. \cite{fb_test_places_1,fb_test_places_2} \\
As for results in developmental psychology regarding ToM, Kosinski refers to the work of Wellman et al. which agglomorates several studies on ToM (and other attributes) of children mainly aged from 2.5 to 6 years old and interpolates their performance on both Smarties and Sally-Anne Tasks \cite{tom_children_2001}. The results of this paper are used to compare the performance of LLMs on similar tasks to the performance of children in an attempt to assign an age to the level of reasoning LLMs supposedly posses.

\subsection{Large Language Models}
The second foundational knowledge related to Kosinski's paper is that about Large Language Models. 
- abilities seem to emerge
- not able to steer development
- outperform humans in many tasks
