\section{Reviewer Perspective}
%What is the strength of the paper? What are its weaknesses?
Strengths:
- interesting premise
- rewriting of existing ToM tests
- well structured reasoning
- in-depth showcasing and visualisation of findings
- relation of ToM abilities to human age

Weaknesses:
- assumption of model not knowing the ToM problem by rewriting it
- missing data for study 3
- location and contents tasks are "remarkably equivalent"\cite{tom_children_2001, p. 665}
- age comparison is a bit wonky regarding the figures in \cite{tom_children_2001, p. 665} i.e. reading the values has high error also studies with suspects aging well over 5 years are few in the used reference
